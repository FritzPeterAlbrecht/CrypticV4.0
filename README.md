#### Features

The Blinkt! 8 LED module you will show the daily and weekly change of your chosen coin in four different scales: 0.5% / 1% / 2% / 4% per LED - so you have a minimum percentual change of 0.5% and maximum percentual change of 32%. Depending on the direction of the animation and the color range you can read if it shows a positive or negative value.

The LEDShim will show the ROI - Return on Investment on a 28 LED scale.

The ScrollphatHD will be used as for a scrolling ticker like this: [rank] - ticker symbol - actual Price - daily change % - total value of your coins

...for the positive value animations...

```
"half_up":
    {
        "r": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "g": [160, 140, 120, 80, 40, 20, 10, 0],
        "b": [200, 200, 200, 220, 220, 250, 250, 250]
    },
          End----------------------------------------Start
```
...for the negative value animations...
```
"half_down":
    {
        "r": [10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 230],
        "g": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "b": [250, 230, 210, 200, 180, 160, 150, 130]
    },
          Start----------------------------------------End
```
...and for the LED Shim.
```
"led_shim":
    {
        "r": [0, 0, 0, 0, 210, 200, 190, 180, 170, 160, 150, 140, 130, 120, 140, 140, 140, 150, 160, 160, 140, 120, 100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 0],
        "g": [250, 230, 220, 210, 190, 180, 160, 140, 120, 100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "b": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 210, 240, 250]
